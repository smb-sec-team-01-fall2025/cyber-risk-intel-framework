## Secret Management Policy

- **Production & Staging Secrets**: Managed securely in the production VM environment. Access is restricted.
- **Local Development Secrets**: Stored in `/env/.env`. This file **must not** be committed to Git. The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent this.
- **No Secrets in Code**: Under no circumstances should secrets (API keys, passwords, private certificates) be hard-coded. Always use environment variables referenced from the configuration files.
- **Key Rotation**: API keys and other secrets should be rotated periodically and immediately if a leak is suspected.
