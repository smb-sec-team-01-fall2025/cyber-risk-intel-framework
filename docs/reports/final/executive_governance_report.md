## POA&M Status

### Plan of Action & Milestones

| Finding | Severity | Status | Due Date |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| Implement MFA for admin accounts | High | In Progress | Dec 15 |

2. Address the 3 high-risk items in risk register
3. Finalize MFA implementation for admin accounts

### Short-Term (30 Days)

1. Increase control implementation rate to 85%
2. Reduce high-risk assets to zero
3. Complete all POA&M items

### Long-Term (90 Days)

1. Achieve 95% CSF coverage
2. Implement automated compliance reporting
3. Expand OSINT source coverage
