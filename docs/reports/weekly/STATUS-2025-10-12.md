# Weekly Status â€” 2025-10-12

## Completed

- **Full Asset CRUD:** Implemented complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for assets via both the API and the frontend UI.
- **Bulk Asset Import:** Fixed and stabilized the CSV/JSON bulk import feature. The frontend now correctly handles file uploads, and the backend processes them reliably.
- **Identify Agent MVP:** Implemented the first version of the Identify Agent. It can be triggered via the API to perform initial asset classification and link open-source threat intelligence events to assets based on matching IP addresses.
- **Dynamic Risk Scoring:** The asset risk scoring algorithm now dynamically updates based on asset criticality, data sensitivity, and the number of linked threat intelligence events.
- **End-to-End Stability:** Resolved numerous critical bugs, including Docker networking issues, Nginx proxy misconfigurations, and frontend data parsing errors, to achieve a stable, fully operational state for the application.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:**
  - Corrected the risk score display on the main assets table.
  - Improved the sidebar navigation for a cleaner look.
  - Fixed table cell sizing for better visual consistency.
  - Resolved a bug requiring a double-click on the file import button.
  - Ensured the sample CSV template download works correctly.
- **Documentation:** Updated user guides with detailed `curl` examples for all new asset management features.

## In Progress

- Refining the Identify Agent's asset classification logic.
- Improving error handling and user feedback on the frontend for API interactions.

## Blockers / Help Needed

- None.

## Next Week Plan

- **Enhance Identify Agent:** Add more sophisticated intel-to-asset linking logic beyond simple IP matches (e.g., hostname, domain).
- **Begin Protect Agent:** Start development of the "Protect Agent" MVP, focusing on generating initial security recommendations for high-risk assets.
- **User Authentication:** Begin scoping the requirements for implementing user login and authentication.
